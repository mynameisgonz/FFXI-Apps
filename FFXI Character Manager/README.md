FFXI Character Manager is an addon that allows you to quickly swap between open instances of FFXI (Windower). You can either click the buttons on screen or use hotkeys on your keybard to flip instantly. NO MORE ALT TABBING!

This application does not hook into POL/FFXI/Windower and does not do anything more than get the open POL Processes, makes a list, and allows you to swap through them.

If you want to change the keybinds, open the FFXI Character Manager.dll.config file and modify the values of Box1-6:

The accepted values can be found here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.forms.keys?view=windowsdesktop-6.0

If you do not follow these values, the app is likely to break.

The app will also save the last place you had it on screen and open in that position when you reopen it.

The app is ALWAYS on the top of the screen but can be minimized if you are using hotkeys and dont want to see it.

This app requires you RUN AS ADMIN because of POL/FFXI's requirement to run as admin as well. You can either right-click run as admin or set it in the security sections
